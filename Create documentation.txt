create me a short description of this project 

ChatGPT
The project is a .NET 6 Web API application focused on managing country information. The application includes a CountriesController that provides different HTTP endpoints for fetching country-related data. The controller leverages a service interface called ICountryService to fetch the required data.

Endpoints:

GET api/Countries/fetchCountries: Fetches countries based on a RequestModel that can include parameters like name, sort order, and limit. The countries are fetched asynchronously.

GET api/Countries/byName: Fetches countries filtered by their name. The response can also be sorted and limited by the number of records.

GET api/Countries/byPopulation: Fetches countries filtered by their population. Similar to the byName endpoint, the response can be sorted and limited by the number of records.

All endpoints have error handling, which returns a BadRequest status code along with the exception message if something goes wrong. The project relies on Dependency Injection to inject ICountryService into the controller, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
